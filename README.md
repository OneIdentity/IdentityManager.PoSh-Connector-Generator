# IdentityManager.PoSh-Connector-Generator
Identity Manager provides a rich set of [out-of-the-box integrations](https://www.oneidentity.com/one-identity-manager-integration). This includes many generic connectors and cloud application connectors via [Starling Connect](https://www.oneidentity.com/products/starling-connect/).

To connect non-generic unsupported systems Identity Manager also provides you with the option of building your own custom connector using Windows PowerShell.

[Creating a PowerShell Synchronization Project](https://support.oneidentity.com/de-de/technical-documents/identity-manager/9.1.1/windows-powershell-connector-user-guide/2#TOPIC-1994514) is a multi-step process.

The first and crucial step in that process is creating a Connector Definition File (**CDF**), written in XML, which describes the structure of the target system and the Windows PowerShell cmdlets to use.

You can find an example of a definition file on the One Identity Manager installation medium in:
/Modules/TSB/dvd/AddOn/SDK/ADSample.xml

This solution accelerator simplifies the step of creating the CDF by providing a UI to graphically configure the interface which will be exposed to the Identity Manager Synchronization Engine.

The solution accelerator generates the CDF and also an accompanying **PowerShell Module** or **C# Class**. The generated code leverages the Fa√ßade Pattern with one auto-created method per CRUD operation. By using this approach developers can cleanly separate the interface definition and connector code.

The actual connector code can then be developed seperately in **PowerShell** or **C#**, tested and then plugged into the generated structure.
